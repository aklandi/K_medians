# K_medians

For the K_medians assignment, we continue our clustering discussion with K-Medians, an alternative method to K-Means.  Again, I've included slides (in kmedians.pdf).

* In python_kmedians.py, you will find skeleton code for the assignment.  This is for those who are struggling with how to get started!
* In geom_median.py, the full code for how to find the geometric median is provided.  You are not expected to program this since, as I state in class, this is an entirely separate optimization research problem we will not study in depth.  You will need to keep this in the same directory as python_kmedians.py
* In Pokemon.csv, I've provided the pokemon data for you to play around with if you choose.  There are approximately 800 rows which contain pokemon names, their corresponding types, and several statistics.  This data set is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon/data.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me!
